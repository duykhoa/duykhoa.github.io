My name is Kevin Tran, and I&rsquo;m a Software Engineer with a burning passion for all things DevOps. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of contributing to successful projects across diverse industries, from private banking to ride-hailing and even the automotive world.
For the past five years, I&rsquo;ve been invested my time in building microservices. To ensure top-notch code delivered, I rely on Test-Driven Development and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). While I spent a good chunk of time developing applications with Ruby on Rails and Hanami, I&rsquo;ve recently transitioned to more flexible, high-performance technologies like Go, Java, and NodeJS. I&rsquo;m a big fan of monorepos and trunk-based development. Plus, I love creating internal tools to make life easier for fellow engineers."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.135.0"><meta name=ROBOTS content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.ico type=image/x-icon></head><body><nav class=navigation><a href=/><span class=arrow>←</span>Home</a>

I also design and manage the infrastructure behind these apps using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Think of it as an automated blueprint for building everything. Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes are my weapons of choice. If containers are your thing, you&rsquo;ll be happy (or not) to know I&rsquo;ve got experience working with Kubernetes and Openshift as well. Make sure you checkout my posts in the future about these topics.</p><p>Now, enough about work! When I&rsquo;m not coding or wrangling infrastructure, you can find me on the badminton court, conquering hills on my bike, or hitting the pavement for a good run.</p><p>This blog is my space to share my knowledge, explore DevOps trends, and delve into the ever-evolving world of software development. So, buckle up and get ready for some insightful discussions, practical tips, and maybe even a few war stories along the way!</p><hr><p>If you wonder if I&rsquo;m a real person.
