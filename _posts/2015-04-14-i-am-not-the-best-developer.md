title: I am not the best developer
---

Before start, I tell you: I used to think that I am the best developer.
It's normal to thing, right? I find nothing bad to think i'm the best developer.

Why?
- I always try to solve all the problems; because I'm the best, if I can't solve it, who else can?
- I do my best: writing the best code, sharing the best techniques I used.
- I always try to help people, suggest them best ideas and help them solve their problem in the smartest way.
- I learn a lot, read a lot, cause I am the best. I need to know a lot, so I can continue helping people, improve them.
And of course, if I don't continue learning, I will slow down, may be sometime I am not the best anymore.

Good philosophy. But what if you see a lot of developer those are better than you. This philosophy created a invisible obstacles, prevents you learn from other people.
I always remind myself to keep the learning process, but something in my gut still stop me go over my philosophy. Damn it!

Actually I don't know why I am afraid of learning from people. What's wrong with my philosophy?

After reading a lot of articles, and think a lot, I think there "may" be a problem in my philosophy
It's too paranoid to say "I am the best developer", even though I don't mean I am perfect, but still say that I am better than every one else.
Instead saying that, I change it to:

"I am not the best developer, I only follow the best discipline".

What is the best discipline? There are 3 things I want to follow:
- Follow TDD. 
- I must proud of my code.
- Learn new thing every day and share it.

For 3 months, I keep doing them everyday, every time. And I found when I follow these, day by day, it becomes a habit.
It isn't easy at all. I get tired, get lazy all the time. I am not hard working style, so I must re-generate the energy every time by coffee ^^.

In the later posts in the category, I will share with you the details of these 3 things above, plus how to apply it and make your work easier than ever.

And back to my problem before, I am not afraid of learning new things from my friends or any one I meet any more. Because it follows my philosophy - to learn new thing everyday and share it.
Just  I want to learn it, so I can share it to another people.

Do you think the same with me? Share me your thoughts below!
