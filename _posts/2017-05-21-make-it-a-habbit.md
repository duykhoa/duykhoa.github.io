Hi everyone, such a long time (10 months omg) I haven't writen anything.

I build this blog myself on Rails, and host it in a Digital Ocean Droplet.
It was a very cool project, I am the developer, but also the boss, and
the user, I understand how each feature bring value to user.

However, from time to time, it becomes difficult to maintain the project.
Manytimes I want to write a post, and the website has some bugs. I spent
my 2 hours to fix bugs instead of providing more contents. It demotivated
me a lot whenever I want to write a blog post.

Anw, I decide to stop support the project and rebuild it in Github page
and focus on content more than the code. The project is cool, and I spent
a lot of times to develop. It was tough to make this decision.

So, I have a new blog using Github page, Jekyll plugin. There is no excuse
about not writing blog post because there is a bug. Of course there is a bug,
however the cost of maintenance the site is much less than.

I want to stop building my blog myself because I think writing content is more
valuable than maintain it. It was hard to make this decision, I love the project
so much, and I am not sure I love writing content in markdown syntax. Also this
time I haven't know how to config the website in Jekyll. After moving, it was
great and I know that I was too conservative. I should have more changes in life
and make it as a habbit. That's what I want to share in this post.

We all want to change our life, our habbit to live better life. We want to get
out of our comfortzone. If we want to have something that we don't have, we must
do something that we haven't done before. These are what we have learnt. I must
say I'm very lucky to learn these lession in my 20s.

However, there is 1 more thing I just discover, I don't like the change, I know the
benefit of changing, but I am afraid of changing.

I love my comfortzone. As a developer, I love my Language I am using, I love
the framework I am using. I love the testing framework I am using. Just kidding,
It is not I love or dont' love, but I am confident to use them. I rarely use
different languages, different frameworks.

I am not good at swimming. I learn swimming because I want to
swim with my girlfriend. Sometimes I want to swim, but go to swimming complex
and swim with many professional swimmers there is a stressful feeling.

I am good a badminton.  I may win or lost, but I am pretty sure I play
well, cause I play badminton for almost 5-6 years. If choosing between badminton
and swimming, definitely I go with badminton, safe choice.

Another example, I always call Ice Latte when I go to the coffee. Sometimes I have
Picolo, or brew. I thought because of my girlfriend. I and her tried many coffee
shops just to figure out the best Ice latte. At first she enjoys it more than
me. After having many ice lattes, it becomes a safe choice for me whenever I go
to coffee shop. Just to see if this coffee shop's ice latte is better.

The last example may not be relevant, just because I am having an ice
latte now, so I put it in my post ^^. I use these examples to prove a point,
if you're confident about onething, you prefer to go with it instead of other
options. It isn't bad, it just limit us to try new things, and it make a habbit
not to try.

Here is the problem for me. It is so hard to try new thing, eventhough I have
methods, I have motivation, I have some reasons. I did hard to found them, but
I still don't take action, because I don't have the habbit of doing new thing.

My problem isn't because I don't have enough reasons, or motivation.
Here's why. Cause I am not confident to challenge myself, to do something I
haven't done before. Eventhough I have quite a lot reason, methods and
motivation, I feel not enough yet.

My solution for this is challenge myself more often. I read this blog
https://themission.co/a-list-of-30-day-challenges-you-can-start-today-532c28bc2585

At first, it sounds a bit weird. However, it's exactly what I don't have,
that's why I feel nervous when changing things, when challenge myself to do
something I haven't done before. I may not do anythings in this list, and I
am not able to do it for 30 days, but here is my list of challenges that I at least
make it happened once:

- Cycles 12kms nonstop
- Write a non-tech blog
- Talk to my ex-girlfriend
- Give free advice to some strangers
- Order something different with Ice Latte
- Give a talk about something that isn't related to my experience or knowledge 

And here is somethings I am gonna do next

- Contribute to a Golang lib (haven't)
- Pushup 100 times nonstop
- Writing a blog about Psychology or personal development
- Go some places alone
- Find her again
