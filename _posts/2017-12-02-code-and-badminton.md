title: Code and Badminton

---
Random thoughts about badminton and code, hopefully can form a good post.

I was lied to you by saying "I spend half of my life with code, and another half
with coffee." in my previous post. I have spent another chunk of my time for
badminton. Plus a bunch of time for reading book. It's different story. This post
I want to share how playing badminton helps me in coding.

To be able to write a program, a simple program, we need to know the
programing language we are going to write the program by. We need to learn
programming language syntax. How to write a function, how to write a class. And
which tool should we use to write code, to compile and execute the program.

The samething applies for badminton, we need to know its rules. To play badminton,
we need to follow its rules. We can't score by hitting the shuttle outside of
the court. We can't score by touching the net. We also need to know shuttle cock,
racket we can use to play badminton.

In order to play a badminton game, knowing the rules is not enough. We need to
learn how to perform different shots, we need to learn how to move, how to
defense from an attack. Of course the first thing to learn is how to serve.

After knowing these skills and practice for a while, the next step is learn how
to play a good game. That's where strategy comes in. By using the word "good
game", I don't mean a "win game". These words are different, but for us,
sometimes we just assumed they are the same.

Knowing a programming language isn't enough. To be able to work as a developer,
we need to have something more than just a programming language. We need to learn
how to write code, how to use your editor, how to write test, how to refactor the
code, how to read other code.

To write a good code, it requires strategy as well as badminton.
Knowing different way to approach a problem, how to refactor code, how to write
test for a feature or a function. When working in a real project, it requires to
perform these skills together, combine separate skills into one.

I've played more than a thousand badminton games, I am a bit afraid of saying I'm
a good player, may be using an intermediate player.
Of course I have developed some special skills and some special shots, there are
still a lot of things I need to learn. However I am confident that I can perform
well in every game. And this is the secret, I play serious and respect my
opponents.

If we agree in "good game" isn't about win and lose, we may find out that to say
a good game, it's just about ourselves's feelings whether we performed well.
In software development, we see ourselves perform well based our feeling on the output
of work - the code we wrote. We feel good when the code follows the standards,
these are readable, extensible. To keep this standard in our code, it requires a
strong discipline, and more or less, think about other team members may inherit
our code in the future.

I hope you find it makes sense to you until this point. For the next part I want
to discuss about concepts in badminton, and see how it related to code. Warning,
I will dump to you more about badminton than code.

1. We need to hit the shuttle from a distance

    The most basic concept in badminton is hitting the shuttle from a distance.
    Imagine you want to hit the wall, the power you can generate when you put
    your fist on the wall, and then perform a punch is significantly weaker
    than when you start from a distance to the wall.

    Knowing the different, the next question is how to hit from a distance. It's
    very simple, we need to know where the shuttle will be hit and prepare before
    it comes.

1. Timing

    Playing badminton, timing is the most important thing.
    People often see the shuttle moves too fast, players need to move fast and
    early toward the shuttle. Not true. Move too early or too late are both no
    good.

    The time do we use to determine whether we move early or late is the time our
    opponent's racket touch the shuttle.

    To have a good timing, we must know where to hit the shuttle in order to
    prepare for a move toward the shuttle.

1. Different grip for different shots

    You may think there is only one way to hold the racket, or holding it by any
    way doesn't matter. That isn't true. Different kind of shot requires different
    grips.

    Some grips are quite similar, however a tiny different makes a huge different.
    I am going to give an example. We can't use forehand grip to hit a backhand
    shot. In backend shot, the wrist rotate and send the power to the racket through
    the thumb. In forehand shot, the power is generated from swing, and the more
    gaps between racket and palm, the more powerful shot you can perform.

1. The ultimate purpose of different kind of shots

    Perform different kind of shots makes a better game. Imagine if you can only
    perform 1 kind of shots, your opponent know where I am gonna hit and prepare
    even before my racket touch the shuttle. They can plan far ahead, and I am
    gonna lose.

    For the same position of the shuttle, we can return in different ways. An
    forehand shot can be returned by a forehand shot, a drive, a drop, plus cross
    court forehand, cross court drive, cross court drop. An netshot can be returned
    by a tap, flick, netshot, plus cross court hit.

    Some shots are more difficult than other. The risk to fail this shot is higher.
    Despite a lot of practice, there is still riskier than other shot. However,if we
    successfully perform this shot, the more chance we win this point.

1. Learn from the top players

    There are a lot of good players. In my time, there are Lindan, Lee Chong Wei,
    Lee Yong Dae, Tien Minh, Fu HaiFeng, Kevin Sanjaya, Taufik... And their games
    are recorded and public in Youtube, Facebook. There are also some commentator
    clips that explain how they play. All are available for free. If we want to
    learn from them, just start typing on your browser their name, and watch.

    Sometimes I ask myself, how to return this shot. I may not find the answer
    immediately, but I now know where to find the answer.

1. Practice
  
    Practice make perfect. It trains our subconsciousness to learn and react to an
    action.

    When we are in a training, we can pay attention to our posture, our wrist, our
    legs, how we are gonna move. When we are playing, we don't have time for these,
    we focus more about the shuttle & game strategy, these thing should be done
    automatically without conscious. If we need to pay attention of this concrete
    things, we don't have enough time to read the game strategy and our opponents.

1. Smashing

    Smashing is the most powerful shot in badminton, and it's the most favorite
    shot for all players.

    When I started playing badminton, I see smashing is so cool, I want to learn it
    by the way. Imagine a player jumps high in the air, swing the racket with full
    power, hit the shuttle. The sound of shuttle and the string likes the gun shot,
    and the shuttle fly like an arrow to the opponent court.

    Ofcourse, there is drawback. Smashing requires more energy. It does require
    more time to recover. If your smash isn't dangerous enough, opponent can return
    it and you may need to pay extra more energy to recover and catch the next shot.

1. Trickshot
