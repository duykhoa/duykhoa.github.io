An rough opinionated idea on how to build a working product.

<!--more-->

Happy new year!

This year is an unique year ever. It is a boring year but also a stand by year to make myself ready in different aspects
of life.

Hence I want to write a notes for myself and for everyone who reaches to my blog.

I have wondered a lot of what makes a product successful.

Nowadays there are many product that failed from the execution phase, some products failed in even earlier phases.

The earlier it fails, the less damage it does.

2 things to consider while building the product: realize and accept failure and move on, adjust the goal quickly and
turn the direction.

Product usually starts with a superb idea, and the dangerous thing is the plan.

People talk about planning the whole time. The plan is usually a long term plan.
It is usually filled up with details for 10 years vision stuffs.

My question is what should be in the plan that make it doable and believable?

Keeping the size small is definitely important thing when starting a product.
Ensure everything is in small size, includes no. people, product requirements, customers, collaboration and communication.

With the mindset of keep things minimal, we can figure out what to include in the product, what kind of customers, users
we want to target. All of that must fit in the minimal resource we have.

I hope you have a wonderful year 2021. Let your inspiration sows. Take care, stay healthy and safe!

Best,
