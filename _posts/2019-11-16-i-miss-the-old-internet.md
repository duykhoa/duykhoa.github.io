With some various kinds of alcohol.

Here is the post [miss old internet](http://misc-stuff.terraaeon.com/articles/miss-old-internet.html)

And I miss the internet.

How?

My first time surfing internet was in 2004, and I don't know anything but the google mail.

I don't know facebook until the second year of university.

I like the simple tradition music's story or the old simple movie dramma last time.

None of my friends like this music.

First time I listen to this music with my father, via the FM radio, and via the cassets.

Bunch of nonsense things...

We are all growth.

Things are from the past, which is not just the past, but the foundation of the future.
