Hello world!

I'm a Software Engineer with passion in the Devops site. I have contributed multiple successes of various business domains, which includes the private banking, ride-hailing and automotive.

I've used some Web technologies, which are varied by the work requirements. For the last 2 years, I have insensitively developed the GRPC and GraphQL micro-services using Typescript.

I have advocated in building a high reusability codebase with the support Monorepo and Trunk Base Development, put together with the internal tools to provide a pleasant development experience.

I am taking care of the design, building, and maintaining the Infrastructure of Integrated Auto Experience. The infrastructure is implemented with the Infrastructure as Code philosophy, using Terraform, Ansible and Jenkins.

Besides that, I have experienced in developing application using containerized platform (Kubernetes, and Openshift). I've worked with Ruby (Ruby on Rails, Hanami) for a long period of times before moving to less opinionated and higher performance technologies, including Go, Java, and NodeJS.

On the personal side, I like playing Badminton, cycling and running.

Here is my latest photo cycling around the [Iron Horse Trail](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/parks-and-trails/iron-horse-trail.aspx)

I hope to reach out to everyone around the world!
