## I'm glad that you are here.

This personal blog is my garden that sows inspiration seeds for everyone who visit can reap.

I am a developer, web developer for more accurate.
I write code, and I like typing on my keyboard.

I share whatever I find it useful from daily life.

Learning is the kind of homeworks that every developer have to do, and all programmer are happy to do it. Just don't
forget that we still have another part of life that needs to maintain as well.

As you can see, most of the posts aren't about code and technology. I do it for purpose.
I believe a programmer is deserved to have a life outside of work, that can be something about sports, relationship, hobby,
game, etc.

However, if a programmer doesn't do the homework, s(he) can enjoy his/her another life?

I hope my posts can conceive some ideas that saves some time for programmers who are busy to do
their homework, that they can't afford their time for experimenting the other life. Of course, I have to do my
homework also, what I have known is very limited.

A bit too long for an introduction, sorry for the hurry people.

I'm living in Singapore. I was moving to Singapore (I'm Vietnamese) for 4 years.

I can code in Ruby (Ruby on Rails, Hanami, Sinatra, Rack), Javascript (Polymer,
React), NodeJS, Go, Java (7 and 8), Search Engine, Relational and Not Relational Database.
I have some experiences to work with people (making people work together while I grinding coffee for them, just
kidding).

I can make good coffee. I'd like to try different coffee bean and different way to make coffee.

Here is a coffee I have everyday:
