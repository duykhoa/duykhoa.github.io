Inspired by Uncle Bob Kata, I am making this website like a show case of TDD.

What I learned when developing software is developers love to write good code.
But to write a good code isn't easy. And keep the code good all time is even harder.

Sometimes we're in rush by the project manager, or to follow deadline, or by fixing a critical bug
on production, we allow ourself to write not good code. I do it all the time, and I always promise
to myself I will refactor it, I will rewrite it soon.

But you know it was and will never happen, not because I'm lazy. The number of tasks are just increased
everyday, it means the logic gets more complicated.  We are so affraid to break the current code.
The code is working well, if we rewrite it, how do we make sure it'll work better???

That's why we need the test. And write good test and write enough test is even harder.
There is technique to help write better tests, it's TDD. The technique is: we write
test first, then write code. So every line of code you write is proof by the test,
and you can feel free to change the code, if there is no fail test.

It's simple technique, but I found it's so hard to apply it in real.
I spent a lot of time to try and fail. I guest if you are looking to this site, you tried to use TDD
before at least once, right?

I really want to share what I learn from TDD, how I and we should apply TDD in a practical way.
I use "tdd kata" word from uncle Bob lessons about Clean code.
So every week I will solve a problem (mostly a computation problem, related to algorithm or data structure)
combine of TDD & Algorithm. I hope you support me by subscribe the email list, so you can get the latest
katas every week, and you can comment on each kata or suggest which problem I should try to apply TDD in.
Also I will share some tips, how I do fail when solving a specific problem, then we can discuss how to
avoid them in another problems.

With :coffee: and :joy:
